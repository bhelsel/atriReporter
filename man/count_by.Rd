\title{Count occurrences by position across IDs}
\usage{
count_by(data, id, ..., column, value = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the data to analyze}

\item{id}{An unquoted column name representing the ID variable to group by}

\item{...}{Grouping variables to count by (e.g., site_label)}

\item{column}{An unquoted column name to filter and count}

\item{value}{The value to filter for in the column (default: 1)}
}
\value{
A data frame with:
\item{variable}{The name of the column that was counted}
\item{1, 2, 3, ...}{Columns representing each position, with values
indicating how many IDs had an occurrence at that position}
}
\description{
This function counts how many IDs have a value of 1 at each sequential
position. It's useful for understanding the distribution of repeated
measurements or events across subjects.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Count how many subjects completed a task at each time point
count_by(atri_cognition, ids, crtt_done)

# Use with map to count multiple variables
purrr::map(
  c("crtt_done", "dsmse_done"),
  ~ count_by(atri_cognition, ids, !!rlang::sym(.x))
)
}
}
